## Overview
# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions for continuous deployment. Every change made to the `index.html` file in the `main` branch triggers a deployment to GitHub Pages.

## How it Works
1. Changes to `index.html` trigger the `deploy.yml` workflow.
2. The workflow deploys the changes to GitHub Pages.

#When to Use Jekyll vs Hugo??
##Jekyll:
-Ideal for blogs and sites with simple structures.
-Has built-in support for GitHub Pages.
-Requires Ruby to install.

##Hugo:
-Faster and better for large sites.
-More lightweight and easier to set up.
-Requires no specific platform dependencies (runs with a single binary).
